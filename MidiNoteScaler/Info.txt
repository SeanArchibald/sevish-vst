MidiNoteScaler is a neat MIDI utility to scale your MIDI notes to larger or smaller tunings. One use case is to convert a piece of 12-EDO music in to another system such as 19-EDO.

Note this plugin DOES NO RETUNING - it only changes the distance between MIDI notes. You must use your own synth in tandem with this plugin in order to get the desired effect.

MidiNoteScaler also does some rounding to the output MIDI notes, which introduces some error. But that's all part of the fun.
